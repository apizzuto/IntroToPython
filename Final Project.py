DESCRIPTION: Though it is inherently incorrect to assume that the stock
market is periodic in its behavior, many trends reflect periodic behaviors.
This program, correcting for inflation, performs a Fast Fourier Transform
of stock market data, after smoothing as well as by implementation of
Welch's method to further smooth data. Suggestions on whether or not
stock should be sold or bought is output based on the derivatives
of the prevailing harmonics.
